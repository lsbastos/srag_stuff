# R scripts for SARI and COVID-19 analysis

This is a repository for R scripts for figures and quick-and-dirty analysis of SARI and SARI-COVID data from open datasets: [InfoGripe](http://info.gripe.fiocruz.br/) and [opendatasus](https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/).

I will use it for my own sake since I am tired to lose the code for some plot I did some time ago. And it is a public repository because it may be useful for someone other than me.
